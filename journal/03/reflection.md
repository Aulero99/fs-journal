# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

## Reaction

This week was pretty difficult to grasp for me at first. I learned my programming skills, minor as they were, in an entirely different era of programming, and as such the MVN pattern of encapsulation was entirely foreign to me. I was taught how to use library items and assemble your code through a compiler language (the name of the language escapes me at the moment, and it is bugging me, but it would compile a library element to an html then export that to the user). I never really dealt with javascript except for quick and dirty fixes for things before they were pushed out to the client for verification. Basically if the client asked for small changes I would do them quickly before sending it back to the rest of the team to actually make it so that it worked with everything else, but my primary job was to work in the HTML and CSS back when we used float instead of flex, which meant I would routinely spend a full day or more tweaking the style of the page until it passed our cross comp checks, and sometimes I would literally spends a week or more if the client was especially demanding. Now with the newer method, I can see the benefits of it, but at the same time they do not mesh well with what I know so I have to unlearn some of the things I know in order to better adhere to the new standards in place.
