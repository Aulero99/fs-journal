Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- What would you count as a victory?


## Week 4

This week we worked in API interfaces, and to be honest, I found it fairly simple. I still get my push post and put's mixed up, but what we handled this week was pretty ok. I was able to finish everything but the pokedex, which I plan on making much better in the future anyway because I want to make an app for tracking where I caught pokemon as well as list the available areas those pokemon are available in. Other than that I got my trivia game to fully working, my gregslist pulls and puts on the page, and the partner project was done minus the stretch goals, overall a much better week than last week for me.
