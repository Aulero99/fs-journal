01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Git is a content control system, not to be confused with github, that allows multiple people to work on content at the same time by managing and tracking changes then apllying those changes onto a central repository, in addition it also timestamps and allows comments on those changes, which in turn makes it easier to roll back code if needed. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | It is used to make a directory using a command line |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

    > | If I overused the '!important' feature I think I would run into a lot of issues on styling larger projects or in collaborative projects. For example there could be multiple styles trying to set the z-height of an object, and if a snippet of javascript someone else made altered it's z-height to somewhere outside my standard range, but I had an z-height!important on it I could run into issues were my javascript would never work. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | The three components of a CSS rule are the Selector, Property and Value. The selector selects the object in the HTML, the property assigns what we are doing to it (in the exaple above we are changing the text color), and the value is what we are changing the value to. |
