# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

## Reflection
This week felt like more reveiw than anything to me as I already had a good grasp on HTML and CSS, however I am still struggling with getting familiar with bootstrap classes, but I am steadily learning them and thier uses. I also keep forgetting the code to take a dev site in VSCode live - bcw live - for some reason, and I think I will continue to forget that going forward knowing myself.
