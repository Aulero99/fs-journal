# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Input

This week reminded me of how selective my memory can be sometimes. I worked at social eyes marketing straight out of HS, and interned there during HS doing front end design work, yet I still cant remember what the darn language we used off the top of my head, for the record it was php, we used php. The vue framework reminds me a lot of my surface level understanding of php in its use of libraries to assemble pages, but unlike php, we have far more flexibility in how we assemble those components together.
