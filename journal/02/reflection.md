I had a lot of fun reveiwing and learning new ways of apllying javascript. While I don't have a lot of experience working in Javascript, I am also not unfamiliar with the core concepts of the language. As such I was able to grasp the concepts fairly quickly, and my habit of labelling everything comes in handy when you are trying to get code logic to work. I still don't find aything we covered in class too terribly difficult, however I have 0 experience in backend coding so I know this won't last forever.
